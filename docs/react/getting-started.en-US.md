Ant Design React is dedicated to providing a **good development experience** for programmers.

---

You had better learn [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and [ES2015](http://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/) first.

## First Example

The following CodePen demo is the simplest usage case, and it's also a good habit to fork this demo to provide a re-producible demo while reporting a bug. Please don't use this demo as a scaffold in real world.

- [antd CodePen](http://codepen.io/anon/pen/wGOWGW?editors=001)

## Standard Development Flow

You may need to compile and debug ES2015 and JSX, and proxy and deployment in a project.
We provide a work flow which is based on `npm` and `webpack`, here is a guide about how to use this work flow.

### 1. Installation

> Please make sure that you had installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)(> v4.x) before using `antd-init`.

```bash
$ npm install antd-init -g
```

Read [the documentation of `antd-init`](https://github.com/ant-design/antd-init/) and [the documentation of `ant-tool`](http://ant-tool.github.io/) to explore more features.

> Also, you can use scaffold/demo which is provided by community:
>
>   - [react-redux-antd](https://github.com/okoala/react-redux-antd)
>   - [react-antd-admin](https://github.com/fireyy/react-antd-admin)
>   - [react-antd-redux-router-starter](https://github.com/yuzhouisme/react-antd-redux-router-starter)
>   - [react-redux-antd-starter](https://github.com/BetaRabbit/react-redux-antd-starter)
>   - [more](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/issues/129)

### 2. Initiate a Project

Initiate a project with cli commands.

```bash
$ mkdir antd-demo && cd antd-demo
$ antd-init --type plain-react
```

`antd-init` will run `npm install` after a project is created. If it fails, you can run `npm install` by yourself.

### 3. Use antd's Components

You can find a Todo App(an valuable demo) in the project which is create by `antd-init`, but it's not important in this guide.

Replace the content of `src/entries/index.js` with the following code.
As you can see, there is no differeneces between antd's components and usual React components.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { DatePicker, message } from 'antd';

class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      date: '',
    };
  }
  handleChange(date) {
    message.info('Selected Date: ' + date.toString());
    this.setState({ date });
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div style={{ width: 400, margin: '100px auto' }}>
        <DatePicker onChange={value => this.handleChange(value)} />
        <div style={{ marginTop: 20 }}>Date: {this.state.date.toString()}</div>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

> All the components in antd are listed in the sidebar.

### 4. Development & Debugging

Run your project and visit http://127.0.0.1:8989

```bash
$ npm start
```

### 5. Building & Deployment

```bash
$ npm run build
```

Entry files will be built and generated in `dist` directory, then we can deploy it to different environments.

> This guide is designed to help you to understand how to use antd, so it maybe not similar to what you do in real world.
> But you can use those tools in your project, it depends on your work flow.

## Compatibility

Ant Design React supports all the modern browsers and IE8+.

But we need to provide [es5-shim](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/working-with-the-browser.html#browser-support) and other polyfills for IE8/9, and [babel-polyfill](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill/) is a better choice. What's more, use [react@0.14.x](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/01/12/discontinuing-ie8-support.html) to support IE8.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <!-- import stylesheet -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/index.css">
    <!-- Polyfills -->
    <!--[if lt IE 10]>
    <script src="https://as.alipayobjects.com/g/component/??console-polyfill/0.2.2/index.js,es5-shim/4.5.7/es5-shim.min.js,es5-shim/4.5.7/es5-sham.min.js,html5shiv/3.7.2/html5shiv.min.js,media-match/2.0.2/media.match.min.js"></script>
    <![endif]-->
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
  <!-- import common dependencies -->
  <script src="/common.js"></script>
  <!-- import entry file -->
  <script src="/index.js"></script>
</html>
```

You may meet problems like [#28](https://github.com/ant-tool/atool-build/issues/28) and [#858](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/issues/858) for `babel@6.x` doesn't support IE8.

[antd-init](http://github.com/ant-design/antd-init) had solved those problems, and you can refer this [webpack config](https://github.com/ant-design/antd-init/blob/f5fb9479ca973fade51fd6754e50f8b3fafbb1df/boilerplate/webpack.config.js#L4-L8)ã€‚

## Customized Work Flow

If you want to customized you own work flow, we recommend to use [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) to build and debug code.

Also, you can use any [scaffold](https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react#boilerplates) in React ecosystem in your work flow. If you meet problems, you can use our [webpack config](https://github.com/ant-tool/atool-build/blob/master/src/getWebpackCommonConfig.js) and [modify it](http://ant-tool.github.io/webpack-config.html).

There are some [scaffold](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/issues/129) which had integrated antd, you can try and contribute.

## Import on Demand

If we import a component like this `import { Button } from 'antd';`, then all the components of antd will be imported. But, we can import component on demand:

```jsx
import Button from 'antd/lib/button';
```

If you use `babel`, we recommend to use [babel-plugin-antd](https://github.com/ant-design/babel-plugin-antd). This plugin will convert the following code to the above form:

```jsx
import { Button } from 'antd';
```

And, this plugin can load style on demand, too. See: [style](https://github.com/ant-design/babel-plugin-antd#usage).

## Customization

- [Customize Theme](https://github.com/ant-design/antd-init/tree/master/examples/customize-antd-theme)
- [Local Iconfont](https://github.com/ant-design/antd-init/tree/master/examples/local-iconfont)

## Tips

- You can use any `npm` modules.
- We recommend to write code in [ES2015](http://babeljs.io/blog/2015/06/07/react-on-es6-plus), for `babel` had be integrated in our work flow.
